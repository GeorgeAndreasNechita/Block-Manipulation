# Block-Manipulation
First project with Javascript made for a Udemy course in order to learn how to apply Javascript to the websites with the DOM(Document Object Model). It has panels that control the position, size, color,shape and opacity of a square block.

I made some improvements on the original. For example the block changes at the same time when you use the sliders instead of after modifiying them. The HEX text input now displays the color in hex in real time when using the RGBA sliders. The last panel looks much better now, the sliders fit much better.
